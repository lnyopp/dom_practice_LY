Lab
Let's create a simple todo application
• Show an unordered list of todo's
• Show an input to enter a new todo
• Show a button to add a todo. When the button is clicked:
• The text from the input box is used to add a list item to the
bottom of the list
• The text from the input box is cleared out.
• When the user clicks on a list item, it is removed
• Extra Credit: - When a list item is clicked, cross it out,
then remove it after 1 second.

Lab 2 - recreate this same application using jQuery - this code will be the branch called jQuery.
